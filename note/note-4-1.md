# Stub

### üß© **General Meanings of ‚ÄúStub‚Äù**

1. **A short remaining piece of something larger**

   * Example: *a pencil stub* ‚Üí what‚Äôs left after most of the pencil is used up.
   * This is the **core idea**: a stub is a *small, leftover, or partial part* of something bigger.

2. **A small part that serves as a reference or placeholder**

   * Example: *a ticket stub* ‚Üí the small portion you keep after giving the rest to the attendant.
   * It proves or points to something (the full ticket).

3. **In computing or programming:**

   * A **stub** is a small piece of code used to represent a larger or remote process (like a placeholder function).
   * Example: *API stub* or *RPC stub* ‚Äî a dummy component that stands in for a full service.

### üåê **In DNS (Stub Zone Context)**

The term **‚Äústub zone‚Äù** comes directly from that same idea:

* It‚Äôs a **small, partial copy** of a DNS zone.
* It only contains just enough information (NS, SOA, and A records) to point to where the **real, full zone** lives.

So, just like a *ticket stub* refers to the real ticket, a **stub zone** refers to the real DNS zone.


### üß† **Quick Summary**

| Context       | Meaning of ‚ÄúStub‚Äù                       | Analogy       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Everyday life | A short remainder of something larger   | Pencil stub   |
| Tickets       | A small part kept as proof or reference | Ticket stub   |
| Programming   | A placeholder or minimal version        | Function stub |
| DNS           | Minimal zone pointing to the full one   | Stub zone     |

# Stub Zone

A **stub zone** is a special type of **DNS zone** that contains only the essential information needed to locate the authoritative DNS servers for another zone. It acts like a ‚Äúpointer‚Äù to help a DNS server efficiently find where to get the full records for a domain, without storing all the data itself.


### üîç **Definition**

A **stub zone** contains:

1. **NS records** ‚Äî Names of the authoritative DNS servers for the target zone.
2. **A (or AAAA) records** ‚Äî IP addresses of those DNS servers.
3. **SOA record** ‚Äî Start of Authority, which identifies the primary DNS server for the zone.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Purpose**

Stub zones are primarily used to:

* **Maintain delegation information automatically** ‚Äî If the IP addresses or NS records change on the authoritative side, the stub zone updates automatically.
* ==**Improve name resolution** ‚Äî Reduces the need for full recursive lookups.==
* **Enhance fault tolerance** ‚Äî Keeps resolution working even if external links or forwarders fail.
* **Simplify DNS management** ‚Äî Especially in multi-domain or multi-forest environments (e.g., in Active Directory).

### üß≠ **Example**

Let‚Äôs say your internal DNS server needs to resolve names in another domain:

* Your domain: `corp.example.com`
* Remote domain: `sales.example.com`

Instead of creating a secondary zone for `sales.example.com`, you create a **stub zone** for it.
The stub zone will only store:

```
sales.example.com.   IN  NS   ns1.sales.example.com.
sales.example.com.   IN  NS   ns2.sales.example.com.
ns1.sales.example.com. IN A   192.168.10.10
ns2.sales.example.com. IN A   192.168.10.11
```

When a query for `host.sales.example.com` arrives, your DNS server knows exactly which servers to contact.


### üîÑ **Comparison**

| Zone Type          | Contains                          | Updates Automatically? | Use Case                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Zone**   | Full DNS records                  | Manual                 | Authoritative source                 |
| **Secondary Zone** | Full DNS records (read-only copy) | Yes                    | Backup or replication                |
| **Stub Zone**      | Only NS, SOA, and A records       | Yes                    | Locate authoritative servers quickly |

# Domain DNS Zones and Forest DNS Zones

### 1. **Domain DNS Zone**

* A **Domain DNS Zone** is a portion of the DNS namespace that is **associated with a single Active Directory domain**.
* It stores DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, SRV, etc.) that are **specific to that domain**.
* **Scope:** Only within the domain. Each domain in a forest can have its **own DNS zone**.
* **Replication:**

  * Can replicate to all DNS servers **within the domain**.
  * Supports **Active Directory-integrated zones**.

**Example:**
If your domain is `sales.company.com`, a domain DNS zone might be `sales.company.com`, containing records for all hosts in that domain.

### 2. **Forest DNS Zone**

* A **Forest DNS Zone** is a DNS zone that is **available to all domains in an Active Directory forest**.
* Typically used to store DNS records that need to be **shared across multiple domains**.
* **Scope:** Entire forest. All domain controllers in the forest can access the zone.
* **Replication:**

  * Replicates to all DNS servers in the **forest**, not just the domain.
  * Usually Active Directory-integrated.

**Example:**
If you have multiple domains (`sales.company.com` and `hr.company.com`) in a forest `company.com`, a forest DNS zone might be `company.com` itself or a subzone, containing records accessible by both domains.

### ‚úÖ Key Differences

| Feature     | Domain DNS Zone                  | Forest DNS Zone                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Scope       | Single domain                    | Entire forest                          |
| Replication | Domain controllers in the domain | All domain controllers in the forest   |
| Usage       | Domain-specific records          | Records shared across multiple domains |
| Example     | `sales.company.com`              | `company.com`                          |

**In short:**

* **Domain DNS Zone:** localized to one domain.
* **Forest DNS Zone:** shared across all domains in the forest.

# Active Directory

## **1. What is Active Directory?**

Active Directory (AD) is a **directory service** developed by Microsoft for **Windows domain networks**.
==It‚Äôs like a digital ‚Äúphonebook‚Äù for your organization‚Äîit **stores information about users, computers, groups, and other resources** and makes it easy to manage them centrally.==

Think of it as a **central hub** that handles authentication, authorization, and management of network resources.

## **2. Key Components of Active Directory**

1. **Domain**

   * A domain is a logical grouping of network objects (users, computers, devices).
   * Each domain has a **unique name** and a **security boundary**.

2. **Domain Controller (DC)**

   * A server running Active Directory **stores and manages the database** of domain objects.
   * Handles **logins, authentication, and replication**.

3. **Organizational Units (OUs)**

   * Containers used to **organize objects** within a domain.
   * Allows applying **Group Policies** at different levels (like per department).

4. **Forest**

   * The **top-most logical container** in AD.
   * A forest can contain **one or more domains** that share a **common schema and global catalog**.

5. **Tree**

   * A hierarchy of domains within a forest.
   * Domains in a tree **share a contiguous namespace**.

6. **Global Catalog**

   * A **read-only partial replica** of all objects in the forest.
   * Used to **quickly locate objects** across domains.

7. **Sites**

   * Represent **physical locations** of your network.
   * Optimizes **replication and authentication traffic**.

# Active Directory DNS Integration**

* AD heavily relies on **DNS** for locating resources and domain controllers.
* Domain controllers **register SRV records** in DNS for clients to find services.
* Zones can be **domain-wide** or **forest-wide**, as we discussed earlier.

# DNSSEC & NRPT

## **1. DNS (Domain Name System)**

DNS is like the **phonebook of the internet**: it translates **human-readable names** (e.g., `example.com`) into **IP addresses** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`) so computers can communicate.

### Key points:

* **DNS Zones:** Logical sections of the DNS namespace.
* **Records:** Types include:

  * `A` ‚Üí maps a name to an IPv4 address
  * `AAAA` ‚Üí maps a name to an IPv6 address
  * `CNAME` ‚Üí alias to another name
  * `SRV` ‚Üí service location (used in AD)
* **DNS in AD:** Stores records for domain controllers, domain names, and service discovery.

## **2. DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**

DNSSEC adds **security to DNS** by allowing clients to **verify that the DNS data they receive is authentic and untampered**.

### How it works:

1. Zones are **digitally signed** using public key cryptography.
2. DNS resolvers check signatures to ensure data **hasn‚Äôt been altered**.
3. Helps prevent attacks like:

   * **Cache poisoning**
   * **Man-in-the-middle attacks**

### Key points:

* DNSSEC does **not encrypt the data**, it only **authenticates it**.
* Works with existing DNS infrastructure but requires **signed zones** and **DNSSEC-aware resolvers**.


## **3. NRPT (Name Resolution Policy Table)**

NRPT is a **Windows feature** used with **DirectAccess, VPN, and enterprise networks** to control **how DNS queries are resolved**.

### How it works:

* NRPT allows administrators to **specify DNS policies for specific namespaces**.
* Rules can force queries to:

  * Use **specific DNS servers**
  * Require **DNSSEC validation**
  * Bypass normal DNS resolution for certain domains

### Example:

* You can configure NRPT so that all queries for `corp.example.com` go to your **internal DNS server** and **must be DNSSEC validated**.
* Useful for **secure internal networks** and **remote access scenarios**.

### **4. How They Relate**

| Feature | Purpose                             | Relation                                                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DNS     | Resolves names to IPs               | Base system                                                           |
| DNSSEC  | Adds security to DNS                | Ensures the DNS responses are authentic                               |
| NRPT    | Controls DNS behavior per namespace | Can enforce use of DNSSEC or specific DNS servers for certain domains |

# LDAP

## **1. What is LDAP?**

**LDAP** stands for **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**.
It is a **protocol used to access and manage directory services** over a network. In other words, it‚Äôs the language computers use to **query and update directory information**.

Think of LDAP as the **communication standard** between clients (like computers or apps) and a directory service (like Active Directory).

## **2. LDAP and Active Directory**

* ==**Active Directory (AD)** uses **LDAP as its main protocol** for directory queries and management.==
* LDAP allows you to:

  * Search for users, computers, groups, and other objects
  * Authenticate users
  * Modify object attributes

**Example:**

* Query: ‚ÄúGive me the email address of `John Smith`‚Äù
* LDAP translates this request and pulls it from AD.

---

## **3. LDAP Structure**

LDAP organizes data in a **hierarchical tree called DIT (Directory Information Tree)**.

### Key components:

1. **Entries**

   * Each object (user, computer, group) is an entry.
   * Entries are made of **attributes** (like name, email, department).

2. **Distinguished Name (DN)**

   * Unique identifier for each entry in the tree.
   * Example:

     ```
     CN=John Smith,OU=Sales,DC=example,DC=com
     ```

     * `CN` = Common Name
     * `OU` = Organizational Unit
     * `DC` = Domain Component

3. **Attributes**

   * Key-value pairs describing an entry.
   * Examples:

     * `cn`: John Smith
     * `mail`: [john.smith@example.com](mailto:john.smith@example.com)
     * `userPrincipalName`: [john.smith@example.com](mailto:john.smith@example.com)

4. **Object Classes**

   * Define what attributes an entry can have.
   * Example: `user`, `computer`, `group`, `organizationalUnit`.

---

## **4. LDAP Operations**

Common LDAP operations include:

| Operation   | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Bind**    | Authenticate to the directory              |
| **Search**  | Query objects in the directory             |
| **Add**     | Create a new object                        |
| **Modify**  | Change attributes of an object             |
| **Delete**  | Remove an object                           |
| **Compare** | Check if an attribute has a specific value |
| **Unbind**  | Close the connection                       |

---

## **5. LDAP Ports**

* **389** ‚Üí Standard LDAP (unencrypted)
* **636** ‚Üí LDAP over SSL/TLS (LDAPS) ‚Äì secure version

---

## **6. LDAP Queries**

* LDAP queries use a **filter syntax** to search the directory.
* Example: Find all users in Sales:

  ```
  (&(objectClass=user)(department=Sales))
  ```

---

### **Summary**

* LDAP is a **protocol**, not a database.
* AD is a **directory service** that implements LDAP.
* LDAP allows **search, authentication, and management of directory objects**.
* Works with hierarchical structure: **Forest ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí OU ‚Üí Objects**.
