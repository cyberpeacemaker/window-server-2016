Great — let's clarify the **difference between classful and classless addressing** in IP networking, as it’s a fundamental concept in understanding how IP addresses and subnets work.

## 🔹 Classful IP Addressing (Old/Legacy)

Classful addressing is the **original method** of dividing IP address space. It divides the IPv4 address space into **fixed classes** based on the first few bits of the IP address.

### 🧱 IP Address Classes:

| Class | Starting Bits | Range (1st Octet) | Default Subnet Mask | Number of Hosts |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| A     | `0`           | 1 – 126           | 255.0.0.0 (/8)      | ~16 million     |
| B     | `10`          | 128 – 191         | 255.255.0.0 (/16)   | ~65,000         |
| C     | `110`         | 192 – 223         | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | 254             |
| D     | `1110`        | 224 – 239         | — (Multicast)       | —               |
| E     | `1111`        | 240 – 255         | — (Experimental)    | —               |

==* **Note:** `127.x.x.x` is reserved for loopback (localhost).==
* No subnetting used initially — fixed networks per class.

### ❗ Problems with Classful Addressing:

* **Wasteful**: A Class A network had 16 million IPs even if you only needed 10.
* **Inflexible**: Couldn't divide networks efficiently.

## 🔹 Classless IP Addressing (Modern — CIDR)

CIDR = **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**, introduced in 1993 (RFC 1519), to overcome the inefficiency of classful addressing.

### ✅ Features of Classless Addressing:

* **No classes** — any IP can have any subnet mask.
* Uses **CIDR notation**: `192.168.1.0/24`, `10.1.0.0/22`, etc.
* Subnets are based on **prefix length**, not fixed class.
